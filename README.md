 Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the R script, codebook, and other necessary files for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

## Dataset

The data for this project comes from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, which can be found at the following link:

[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

The repository contains the following files:

1. `run_analysis.R`: An R script that performs the following steps:
   - Merges the training and test datasets to create a single dataset.
   - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset.
   - Appropriately labels the dataset with descriptive variable names.
   - Creates a second, independent tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

2. `CodeBook.md`: A codebook that describes the variables, data, and transformations performed on the original dataset to create the submitted tidy dataset.

3. `tidy_data.txt`: The output file generated by the `run_analysis.R` script, which contains the tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

4. `README
